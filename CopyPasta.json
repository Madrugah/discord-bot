    "taylor":"Awesome return to roots for the Resident Evil Franchise, had me literally on the edge of my chair the entire game. As a self proclaimed :hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts:, I was scared :hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts: for the first 3/4, but the end started to slow down on the scares and instead provided you with a creepy atmosphere that made you afraid to get out of your safe zones. easy 10/10 - Taylor"
